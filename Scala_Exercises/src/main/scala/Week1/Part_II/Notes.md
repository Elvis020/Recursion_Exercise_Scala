## Introduction to Scala
* Functions are 1st class citizens
  * Functions are values
  * Functions can be passed as argument
  * Functions can be returned from functions
* Function Traits
  * They are like interfaces in 'Java'
* defs are diff from function values
* Functions vals are instances of the FunctionX
* A HOF
  * A function is a HOF if it accepts a function as input
  * A function is a HOF if it returns a function
* Currying
  * Allows us to pass multiple param lists
  * Makes it eas to specialise functions for particular scenarios
  * Gives nice syntax that feels more like natural inbuilt functionality
  * A method where you can split the parameter types
